<h4>Assuming we are working for a company called Alpha Services Pvt Ltd
- This is an app that manages leaves of the employees
  - It has provision to do following
    - Raised request as an employee
    - Cancel my request if I do not want to be sent to my manager after raising it
    - As a manager, I can approve or deny leaves of employees under me
    
In order to run the code, we need to do following
- Go to location of manage.py file and run the following
- python manage.py runserver

#Todo
My next steps are to do the following:
1. Auth and Authorization
2. Proper error messages if form validation fails
3. Deploy this app to AWS
